# Examples of bulk access to data in Azure Blob Storage

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver2017-asdb](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2017-asdb.md)]

The `BULK INSERT` and `OPENROWSET` statements can directly access a file in Azure Blob Storage. The following examples use data from a CSV (comma separated value) file (named `inv-2017-01-19.csv`), stored in a container (named `Week3`), stored in a storage account (named `newinvoices`).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All the paths to the container and to the files on Blob Storage are **case-sensitive**. If not correct, it might return an error like "Cannot bulk load. The file "file.csv" does not exist or you don't have file access rights."

## Create the credential

The external data source must be created with a database scoped credential that uses the `SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE` identity. To create a shared access signature (SAS) for your storage account, see the **Shared access signature** property on the storage account property page in the Azure portal. For more information on shared access signatures, see [Grant limited access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signatures (SAS)](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview). For more information on credentials, see [CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL](../../t-sql/statements/create-database-scoped-credential-transact-sql.md).

Create a database scoped credential using `IDENTITY`, which must be `SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE`. Use the SAS token generated for the Blob Storage account. Verify that your SAS token doesn't have a leading `?`, that you have at least read permission on the object that should be loaded, and that the expiration period is valid (all dates are in UTC time).

For example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL UploadInvoices
WITH IDENTITY = 'SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE',
SECRET = 'sv=2018-03-28&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rwdlac&se=2019-08-31T02:25:19Z&st=2019-07-30T18:25:19Z&spr=https&sig=KS51p%2BVnfUtLjMZtUTW1siyuyd2nlx294tL0mnmFsOk%3D';
```

## Examples

Along with the examples in this article, you can also review the [Azure SQL Database import data samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sql-db-import-data) on GitHub.

### Access data in a CSV file referencing an Azure Blob Storage location

The following example uses an external data source pointing to an Azure storage account, named `MyAzureInvoices`.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE MyAzureInvoices
    WITH (
        TYPE = BLOB_STORAGE,
        LOCATION = 'https://newinvoices.blob.core.windows.net',
        CREDENTIAL = UploadInvoices
    );
```

Then the `OPENROWSET` statement adds the container name (`week3`) to the file description. The file is named `inv-2017-01-19.csv`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
   BULK 'week3/inv-2017-01-19.csv',
   DATA_SOURCE = 'MyAzureInvoices',
   FORMAT = 'CSV',
   FORMATFILE='invoices.fmt',
   FORMATFILE_DATA_SOURCE = 'MyAzureInvoices'
   ) AS DataFile;
```

Using `BULK INSERT`, use the container and file description:

```sql
BULK INSERT Colors2
FROM 'week3/inv-2017-01-19.csv'
WITH (DATA_SOURCE = 'MyAzureInvoices',
      FORMAT = 'CSV');
```

### Access data in a CSV file referencing a container in an Azure Blob Storage location

The following example uses an external data source pointing to a container (named `week3`) in an Azure storage account.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE MyAzureInvoicesContainer
    WITH (
        TYPE = BLOB_STORAGE,
        LOCATION = 'https://newinvoices.blob.core.windows.net/week3',
        CREDENTIAL = UploadInvoices
    );
```

Then the `OPENROWSET` statement doesn't include the container name in the file description:

```sql
SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
   BULK 'inv-2017-01-19.csv',
   DATA_SOURCE = 'MyAzureInvoicesContainer',
   FORMAT = 'CSV',
   FORMATFILE='invoices.fmt',
   FORMATFILE_DATA_SOURCE = 'MyAzureInvoices'
   ) AS DataFile;
```

Using `BULK INSERT`, don't use the container name in the file description:

```sql
BULK INSERT Colors2
FROM 'inv-2017-01-19.csv'
WITH (DATA_SOURCE = 'MyAzureInvoicesContainer',
      FORMAT = 'CSV');
```

[!NOTE] Validate the firewall setting on the Azure storage account. If the firewall is enabled by selecting the “Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses” for  “Public network access” under “Networking” page of Storage account, then
•	Any request from SQL PaaS service (Azure SQL Database & Azure Managed Instance) which uses the SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE(SAS) token to access storage account would get blocked as AzureSQL & MI are currently not part of Azure trusted services, you might see the below error message for the read operation using bulk insert:
Msg 4861, Level 16, State 1, Line 27
Cannot bulk load because the file "FileName.extention" could not be opened. Operating system error code 5(Access is denied.).
•	This is because only subset of Azure services is on the trusted services list.
•	Please refer the page Trusted access for resources registered in your subscription(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security?tabs=azure-portal#trusted-access-for-resources-registered-in-your-subscription) for the complete list of trusted services and new updates on Azure storage firewall settings.
